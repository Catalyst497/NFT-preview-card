## My process

First! I structured my HTML to my convenince and also with the best practices I know of.
Next! I started with my CSS. Did the general stylings first (such as font-family, font-color[color], etc), moved to the specifics and just enjoyed myself with the entire process till I was done.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox

### What I learned

From this project I learned a few things about practicing:

1. You never actually know it until you've actually done it. This project caused me to take those those skills I thought I already knew and implement in a project.
2. Practicing is what really makes you a programmer. I have watched a bunch of videos on making use of the skills I used in this project and I've seen amazing things being done by using things like flexbox but when I began to write the code for this project, I realized what being a developer really is like. It is less of the theoretical stuff, more of the practical.

Those this project was really simple, it was some really good practice.

### Continued development

- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- React
- Node.js
- MySQL
